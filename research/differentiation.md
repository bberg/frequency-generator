# Differentiation Analysis: Frequency Generator

## Our Current Strengths

### 1. Precision (0.1Hz)
Our current 0.1Hz precision is good for most applications. However, competitors like Szynalski offer 0.001Hz precision. Consider upgrading to match.

### 2. Real-time Visualization
**Major differentiator.** We have both:
- Waveform display (oscilloscope view)
- FFT spectrum analyzer

Most competitors lack any visualization. This is a significant advantage for:
- Educational purposes
- Understanding signal characteristics
- Professional calibration work

### 3. Modern Interface
Our dark-mode, clean UI is more modern than most competitors. This matters for:
- User experience
- Accessibility (dark mode reduces eye strain)
- Professional appearance

### 4. Frequency Sweep
We offer both linear and logarithmic sweeps with adjustable duration, which many competitors lack.

## Gaps to Address

### 1. Speaker Testing Suite
Audio professionals need:
- **Polarity/Phase Test:** Send a pulse, verify speakers move in same direction
- **Stereo Balance Test:** Separate L/R channel test with balance control
- **Subwoofer Test:** Low frequency rumble test (20-80Hz)
- **Full Range Test:** Quick sweep to identify dead spots

### 2. Hearing Test Mode
- Age-related hearing test (test highest audible frequency)
- Audiometric frequencies: 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 Hz
- Simple pass/fail indicators
- Results visualization (informal audiogram)

### 3. Noise Generation
- Pink noise (equal energy per octave - speaker testing)
- White noise (flat frequency response)
- Brown/red noise (deeper, more bass)
- These are essential for speaker testing and room acoustics

### 4. Tinnitus Frequency Matching
- Guided matching workflow
- Octave check (common mistake: matching wrong octave)
- Save/export matched frequency
- Appropriate medical disclaimers
