                <span>What frequency is A440?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>A440</strong> refers to the musical note A above middle C, vibrating at exactly 440 Hz. It has been the international standard for concert pitch since 1955 (ISO 16).</p>
                <p>Orchestras and instruments are tuned so that A4 equals 440 Hz. From this reference, all other notes are calculated using equal temperament (each semitone is a factor of 2^(1/12) apart).</p>
                <p>Some musicians prefer alternative tunings:<br>
                - 432 Hz ("Verdi pitch") - some claim it sounds more natural<br>
                - 442-443 Hz - common in European orchestras for brighter sound<br>
                - 415 Hz - Baroque pitch, used for period-instrument performances</p>

                <span>What is the relationship between frequency and musical pitch?</span>
                <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The relationship is <strong>logarithmic</strong>. Doubling the frequency raises the pitch by exactly one octave. So A4 (440 Hz) and A5 (880 Hz) are one octave apart - they sound like "the same note" at different heights.</p>
                <p>In equal temperament tuning, each semitone is the 12th root of 2 (approximately 1.0595) times the previous note. The formula is:</p>
                <p><code>f = 440 x 2^(n/12)</code></p>
                <p>Where f is frequency and n is the number of semitones from A4.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Sine waves</strong> are pure tones containing only the fundamental frequency - smooth and mellow sounding. They're the building blocks of all other sounds.</p>
                <p><strong>Square waves</strong> contain odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.), creating a hollow, buzzy quality. They sound more aggressive and penetrating.</p>
                <p><strong>Sawtooth waves</strong> contain all harmonics (both odd and even), creating the brightest, most complex timbre. They sound rich and slightly harsh.</p>
                <p><strong>Triangle waves</strong> are similar to sine but with subtle odd harmonics - warmer than sine but softer than square.</p>
                <p>Sine waves are preferred for hearing tests and precise frequency work. Other waveforms are useful for testing harmonic response and speaker distortion.</p>

                <p><strong>Tinnitus</strong> is the perception of sound when no external sound is present. It's commonly described as ringing, buzzing, hissing, or humming in the ears.</p>
                <p>Most tinnitus occurs in the 2,000-8,000 Hz range, often correlating with frequencies where hearing loss has occurred. Current research suggests tinnitus may result from the brain "turning up the gain" to compensate for reduced input from damaged hair cells.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Linear sweeps</strong> change frequency at a constant rate (e.g., 100 Hz per second). A sweep from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz takes equal time to go from 20-100 Hz as from 10,000-10,080 Hz. This means more time is spent in higher octaves.</p>
                <p><strong>Logarithmic sweeps</strong> change frequency exponentially, spending equal time in each octave. Going from 100-200 Hz (one octave) takes the same time as 1,000-2,000 Hz (one octave).</p>

                <p>Fine frequency resolution matters for several applications:</p>
                <p><strong>Musical tuning:</strong> The difference between A440 and A442 (used by some European orchestras) is only 2 Hz. Accurate tuning requires at least 1 Hz resolution.</p>
                <p><strong>Tinnitus matching:</strong> Tinnitus often has a specific pitch. Precise matching helps with targeted masking and notched sound therapy.</p>
                <p><strong>Beating effects:</strong> When two close frequencies sound together, you hear "beats" at the difference frequency. Generating 440 Hz and 442 Hz creates 2 Hz beating - requires fine control.</p>
                <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> Professional audio calibration often uses specific frequencies (1000.0 Hz, not "approximately 1k").</p>

                <p><strong>Resonance frequencies:</strong> If you hit a speaker or cabinet resonance, the resulting buildup can be louder than expected. Sweep slowly and listen for resonances.</p>
                <p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Start at low volume, increase gradually, and watch for distortion or unusual sounds.</p>

                <p>NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) provides these guidelines:</p>
                <p>- <strong>85 dB:</strong> Safe for 8 hours (busy traffic, loud restaurant)<br>
                - <strong>88 dB:</strong> Safe for 4 hours<br>
                - <strong>91 dB:</strong> Safe for 2 hours<br>
                - <strong>94 dB:</strong> Safe for 1 hour (nightclub, loud headphones)<br>
                - <strong>97 dB:</strong> Safe for 30 minutes<br>
                - <strong>100 dB:</strong> Safe for 15 minutes</p>
                <p>For every 3 dB increase, safe exposure time is cut in half.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you need to raise your voice to be heard over the sound, it's likely above 85 dB and could cause damage with prolonged exposure.</p>

                <p>Both have advantages depending on your purpose:</p>
                <p><strong>Headphones are better for:</strong></p>
                <p>- Hearing tests (isolates each ear, removes room influence)<br>
                - Checking for left/right balance<br>
                - Detailed frequency response listening<br>
                - Late-night testing without disturbing others</p>
                <p><strong>Speakers are better for:</strong></p>
                <p>- Room acoustics analysis<br>
                - Testing speaker performance<br>
                - Subwoofer integration<br>
                - More natural listening (sounds comes from outside the head)</p>
                <p>For hearing tests, circumaural (over-ear) headphones provide the most consistent results. For speaker testing, obviously use the speakers you want to test.</p>

                <span>What is 432 Hz tuning?</span>
                <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>432 Hz tuning</strong> (sometimes called "Verdi pitch" after Giuseppe Verdi who advocated for it) means tuning A4 to 432 Hz instead of the standard 440 Hz.</p>
                <p>Claims about 432 Hz include that it's more "natural," mathematically superior, or has healing properties. The evidence for these claims is weak:</p>
                <p>- Blind listening tests show most people cannot distinguish 432 Hz from 440 Hz tuning<br>
                - Mathematical "sacred geometry" claims are numerological, not scientific<br>
                - No peer-reviewed research supports specific health benefits</p>
                <p>That said, if you prefer the sound of 432 Hz tuning, there's no harm in using it. The difference is subtle (about a quarter-tone lower).</p>

                <span>What are Solfeggio frequencies?</span>
                <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The "Solfeggio frequencies" are a set of tones (174, 285, 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 Hz) claimed to have healing properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Important context:</strong> Despite marketing claims, these are not ancient. They were introduced in the 1990s, derived from numerological calculations on Bible verses. The original medieval solfege system (Do, Re, Mi...) had no specific Hz values - it was a system for teaching relative pitch.</p>
                <p>No peer-reviewed research supports the specific claims made about these frequencies. However, any pleasant, sustained tone can support relaxation and meditation. If you find these frequencies helpful, the benefit may come from the act of focused listening rather than the specific Hz values.</p>

                <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-line"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>No.</strong> There is no credible scientific evidence that audible sound frequencies can repair DNA or heal specific conditions.</p>
                <p>Sound waves in air cannot directly interact with molecular structures like DNA - the physics simply don't allow it. DNA operates at the molecular scale; sound waves are macro-scale pressure variations.</p>
                <p>That said, sound and music do have documented psychological and physiological effects: reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, improving mood, and supporting meditation. These are real benefits, but they come from the general properties of pleasant sound and focused listening, not from specific "healing frequencies."</p>
