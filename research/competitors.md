## Competitive Gaps (Opportunities for Differentiation)

### 1. Visualization
Most competitors lack real-time waveform and FFT visualization.
**Our advantage:** We have both waveform and FFT displays.

### 2. Integrated Testing Modes
No single tool combines:
- Precision frequency generation
- Speaker testing (polarity, balance, phase)
- Hearing screening
- Tinnitus matching

### 3. Educational Content
Many sites have minimal explanation of the science.
**Our advantage:** We have educational content; can expand significantly.

### 4. Modern UX
Many competitors have dated interfaces from 2010s.
**Our advantage:** Modern, clean, dark-mode interface.

### 5. Calibration Presets
Most lack organized presets for specific use cases.
**Our advantage:** We have some presets; can expand.

### 6. Pink/White/Brown Noise
Several competitors offer this; we should add it.

### 7. Stereo/Polarity Testing
This is a common feature we should add.
